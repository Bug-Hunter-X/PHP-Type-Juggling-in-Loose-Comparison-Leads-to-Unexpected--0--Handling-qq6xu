This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in PHP related to type juggling and loose comparison. The code uses `==` instead of `===` to compare user input to 0.  This leads to unexpected results when the input is the string "0", which is considered equal to the integer 0 in a loose comparison.  The solution demonstrates the correct use of strict comparison (`===`) to prevent this issue.
