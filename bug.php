This code suffers from a subtle bug related to PHP's type juggling and the behavior of the `==` operator.  The `if` condition `if ($user_input == 0)` will evaluate to `true` not only when `$user_input` is the integer 0, but also when it's the string "0".

```php
<?php
$user_input = ""; // or "0"

if ($user_input == 0) {
  echo "User input is zero.";
} else {
  echo "User input is not zero.";
}
?>
```

This is because PHP's loose comparison (`==`) attempts to convert the operands to a common type before comparison.  In this case, the string "0" is converted to an integer 0, resulting in a comparison of 0 == 0, which is true.
