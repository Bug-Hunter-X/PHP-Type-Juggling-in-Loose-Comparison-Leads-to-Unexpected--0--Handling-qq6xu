The solution is to use the strict comparison operator (`===`) instead of the loose comparison operator (`==`).  Strict comparison (`===`) checks both the value and the type of the operands.

```php
<?php
$user_input = ""; // or "0"

if ($user_input === 0) {
  echo "User input is zero.";
} else {
  echo "User input is not zero.";
}
?>
```

This revised code will correctly identify that an empty string or the string "0" is not strictly equal to the integer 0.
